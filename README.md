# autoencoder-zoo
Classical and variational autoencoders implementations in Keras.

You'll find here different flavours of autoencoders designed to represent handwritten digits (MNIST) in a 2D latent space.
Those files are largely inspired from Fran√ßois Chollet's article: https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html
